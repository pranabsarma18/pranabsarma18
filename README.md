ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm an Electronics Engineering graduate with a passion for diving deep into the latest technologies. From programming and data science to web development, I love exploring and learning new things.

ðŸ“š Currently, I'm into the classic C programming language, studying from the 1978 K&R (Kernighan and Ritchie) book, because understanding the roots of programming is fundamental to mastering the craft.

ðŸ”§ My interests range from Machine Learning to full-stack web development, and I'm always eager to collaborate on innovative projects and explore new opportunities.

ðŸš€ Let's connect and build something amazing together!
